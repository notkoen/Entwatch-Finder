## Entwatch Finder
Credits to Walderr of JAZE.ru for creating the base plugin. I have updated his plugin with English translation, updated commands, new syntax, and more information that would help more with Entwatch creation configs.

## Commands List:
`sm_itemlist` - Prints a list of `weapon_*` entities in a map to console
`sm_envmarkers` - Prints a list of `env_entity_maker` entities in a map to console
`sm_spawnmaker <Entity ID>` - Force spawns an `env_entity_maker` entity
`sm_gotoent <Entity ID>` - Teleports you to where the entity is located in the map.
